You can view a demo of most of the features explained in this video: [YouTube][youtube-video]

<!-- Plugin description -->
This plugin creates a tool-window on JetBrains products (IntelliJ, PyCharm, ...) where you can view GitHub Actions
workflow-runs of the repository. This plugin is a good alternative to alt-tabbing for every time you push some changes
to the branch and want to see whether the repository's checks are passing on your changes.

You can support the development of the plugin and additional advanced features by
[purchasing the plugin on the JetBrains marketplace][marketplace].
